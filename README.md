The project has been developed over a 3 week period as multi subject project for Real World Modelling,
Online Gaming, Games Engineering 2 and AI For Games. This project has been developed in collaboration
with Mateusz Stepien, Ashleigh Henry and Kevin Andersen. The game that we developed has been based of
the Sid Meier's Civilization series. 

The maps generated within this game are created using the cellular automata algorithm.

Online Gaming
----------------------------
For online gaming we have attempted to use the mirror plugin however we were unsuccessful in doing so in the
time period that we had.

Games Engineering 2
-------------------------------
Fuzzy logic calls which are returned to the AI. I have attached the cpp zip for it within the project. 

AI For Games
-------------------------------
Astar path finding can be found with the file MapGrid and FuzzyLogic can be found within the AI behavior. 
The interaction with cities for AI behavior is limited due to the issues with the design of the city.


Real World Modelling
-------------------------------
We have added unit tests where ever we could in order to test the functionality of the different components
within the project.
